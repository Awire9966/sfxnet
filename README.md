# sfxnet
Its been over 2 decades snice the first sfx making softwares where released, and they where limited in customization, and they often cost 20-50 dollars. Its time for a change. Using Sfxnet, you can write a package with all the little bells and wistles. The options are endless.
How it works:
Plug in the zip file you want to add,the zip containing the custom sfx project, the sfx project name(With file Extension!), the directory to save it to, and the mode.(debug or Release)
Watch as the compiler makes your sfx package concept into a reality.

Supports all Net Framework languages.
Enjoy!
